# Local Time 

##### Is an application that eases the process of planning a trip for its users. Our vision was to create an application that can be area where all those who are involved in a trip to participate in the planning. In the future, we'd like to integrate a social method of adding friends to a trip, booking lodging and transportation, and more. At the moment, the user can update trip details about a trip already in the update.
